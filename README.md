# Project Prècis

## Project Description 

Imagine watching a video that is super long. Now imagine you have more important things to tend to. Watching a video that is really long isn't going to help you progress much. Project Prècis solves this very problem. 

It grabs the transcript of any given YouTube video, summarizes it and presents it to the user in a short version. This helps save time and delivers the desirable content to the user. 

## Why is this project needed? 

The amount of videos that's uploaded online is insurmountable. To keep up and take in all the content is quite a feat, a hard one to achieve. Being able to summarize the whole video to take in the information faster is certainly helpful. 

## Tasks

There are two tasks that are to be completed. You don't necessarily have to do both of them, but you will be prioritized if you complete both the tasks. 

## Configuring the work environment 

- Step 1:
Clone the existing repository 
```shell
    $> git clone https://github.com/WSoC-VITAP/WSoC2105-TestRepo.git 
```

- Step 2: 
Create your own branch and work on it. You can achieve the same using the commands below:

```shell
    Command:
      $> git checkout -b <name_regno>
    Example:
      $> git checkout -b manasa_19bce7532
``` 

This will create a new branch and any update you make will be made on this branch. 
Push into the repository once you are done with your work. 

Kindly email me if you require any additional resources or assistance to complete the tasks. I'll be glad to help out in any way possible.
